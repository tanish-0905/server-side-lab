<h2>Elephant Stables</h2>

<p>
The Elephant Stables is a grand structure that once housed the royal elephants
of the Vijayanagara Empire. It contains a row of large domed chambers,
each designed for a single elephant.
</p>

<p>
The architecture shows strong Indo-Islamic influence and reflects the wealth
and power of the empire.
